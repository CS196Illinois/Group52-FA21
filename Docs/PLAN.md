## Project: Drone Programming, autonomous movements, facial recognition and hand poses reactions
- Features: Drone should be able to dodge the obstacles when flying, while carrying tasks like facial recognition, object localization etc. Also the drone should move correspondingly when people give it hand gesture commands.

### Sprint 0
- MVP
- PLAN.md

### Sprint 1
- Set up Drone
- OpenCV, cvzone Tutorial
- Python Tutorial
- Pytorch Tutorial

### Sprint 2
- Read doc for Djitellopy
- Try out some basic movements for the drone programmatically
- Learn theories about object detection, facial recognition, hand pose estimation

### Sprint 3
- Learn more theories, and check out the code repo for specific topics
- Find object detection training data if necessary, transfer learning on the detection model to enable autonomous flying

### Sprint 4
- Move the drone with hand poses
- Facial recognition on people, and maybe input a target and the drone will fly to that target

### Sprint 5
- Cleaning up the code and perfect the functionalities
